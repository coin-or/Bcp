To build the Mkc sample code you first must have built and *installed*
Bcp itself, see the instructions in the INSTALL file in the parent
directory.

Then type 

    make

that creates an executable named 'mkc'. After uncompressing the
problem file you can run executable:

    gunzip mkc.mps.gz
    ./mkc mkc.par
