/**
   The BCP_lp_user class is the base class from which the user
   can derive a problem specific class to be used in the LP process.

   In that derived class the user can store data to be used in the methods she
   overrides. Also that is the object the user must return in the
   USER_initialize::lp_init() method.
   
   There are two kind of methods in the class. The non-virtual methods are
   helper functions for the built-in defaults, but the user can use them as
   well. The virtual methods execute steps in the BCP algorithm where the user
   might want to override the default behavior.

   The default implementations fall into three major categories. 
   <ul>
     <li> Empty; doesn't do anything and immediately returns (e.g., 
          unpack_module_data()).
     <li> There is no reasonable default, so throw an exception. This happens
          if the parameter settings drive the flow of in a way that BCP can't
	  perform the necessary function. This behavior is correct since such
	  methods are invoked only if the parameter settings drive the flow of
	  the algorithm that way, in which case the user better implement those
	  methods (e.g., create_indexed_var()).
     <li> A default is given. Frequently there are multiple defaults and
          parameters govern which one is selected (e.g., test_feasibility()).
   </ul>

	Default: Branch if both local pools are empty. If branching is done
