OVERVIEW
========

BAC is distributed under the Common Public License Version 1.0 and is 
freely redistributable. All source code and documentation is Copyright 
2003-2006 Francois Margot, Carnegie Mellon University, International Business 
Machines Corporation, and/or others. This README may be distributed freely.

BAC is an illustrative example for the Branch-Cut-Price code BCP of 
COIN-OR. BAC illustrates several basic features of BCP and it is hoped
that a study of the BAC example is an almost painless introduction
to BCP. BAC is not an efficient code for doing anything interesting,
besides serving as an example for BCP. The file bac.pdf BACdir serves 
as main support for understanding the code.
