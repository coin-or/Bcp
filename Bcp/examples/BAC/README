In this document, the following names are used:

1. 'Pkg' is the name of the package containing BCP and BAC that you have 
   downloaded.

2. 'coin-Pkg' is the full path to the directory in which you have 
    downloaded Pkg.

3. 'build' is the directory used for the installation of Pkg. This
   directory must have 'lib' and 'include' subdirectories containing
   all the libraries and header files of Pkg, including all the 
   BCP libraries and header files.

OVERVIEW
========

BAC is distributed under the Common Public License Version 1.0 and is 
freely redistributable. All source code and documentation is Copyright 
2003-2007 Francois Margot, Carnegie Mellon University, International Business 
Machines Corporation, and/or others. This README may be distributed freely.

BAC is an illustrative example for the Branch-Cut-Price code BCP of 
COIN-OR. BAC illustrates several basic features of BCP and it is hoped
that a study of the BAC example is an almost painless introduction
to BCP. BAC is not an efficient code for doing anything interesting,
besides serving as an example for BCP. The file bac.pdf (or bac_trunk.pdf,
depending on the version of the code) in BACdir serves as main support for 
understanding the code.
