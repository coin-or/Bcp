**********************************************************************
***                         DOWNLOAD                               ***
**********************************************************************

You can obtain the source code for the Bcp package in two ways:

1. Obtain the source directly from the COIN-OR subversion repository
   (recommended).  For this you needs the program 'svn' installed on
   your machine, and output of "svn --version" must contain 
   "handles 'https' scheme".

   Assuming that you want to download the code into a subdirectory
   "COIN-Bcp", you type

   svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Bcp/trunk Coin-Bcp

2. Download the tarball from http://www.coin-or.org/Tarballs/Bcp and
   extract it, for example, with

   gunzip Bcp-1.1.0.tgz
   tar xvf Bcp-1.1.0.tgz

   More detailed download instructions can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-download

**********************************************************************
***                        CONFIGURATION                           ***
**********************************************************************

Create a build directory along the source you just downloaded or
extracted (e.g., Coin-Bcp), and go into that directory:

   mkdir Coin-Bcp-build
   cd Coin-Bcp-build

Then you type

   ../Coin-Bcp/configure

Note that you might have to specify additional options, in case you
don't want to use the default choices that configure makes (e.g.,
compilers).  Please visit

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-configure

and the Bcp Trac page

   https://projects.coin-or.org/Bcp

for more information.

If everything went fine, you will see at the end of the output

   "Main configuration of Bcp successful"

**********************************************************************
***                COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION                    ***
**********************************************************************

In the directory where you ran the configure script:

1. Compile the code by typing

   make

2. To test if the code works, you can type

   make test

3. To install the code, you type

   make install

   After this, you will find the executables, libraries and header
   files in the "bin", "lib" and "include" subdirectory, respectively.

More information on the compilation and installation can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-compile

**********************************************************************
***                     USING THE LIBRARIES                        ***
**********************************************************************

Now you can link your own code with the installed libraries. There are
a few very easy to understand examples in Bcp/examples/ and a few more
complex applications in the Applications subdirectory.
