MaxCut INSTALL FILE
===================

In this document, the following names are used:

1. 'Pkg' is the name of the package containing BCP and MaxCut that you have 
   downloaded.

2. 'coin-Pkg' is the full path to the directory in which you have 
    downloaded Pkg.

3. 'build' is the directory used for the installation of Pkg. This
   directory must have 'lib' and 'include' subdirectories containing
   all the libraries and header files of Pkg, including all the 
   BCP libraries and header files. The build directory can be any
   directory of your choosing.

4. 'MaxCutdir' is the main directory of the MaxCut example containing this 
   INSTALL file. It is located in build/Bcp/examples/MaxCut.


COMPILATION OF MaxCut
=====================

0. First install BCP.

1. In MaxCutdir, use 'make' to compile the example MaxCut.

2. The executable 'maxcut' is created in MaxCutdir.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

If you have Doxygen available, you can create the html documentation 
by typing

   make doxydoc

in the build directory. Then open the file 

   coin-Pkg/doxydoc/html/index.html 

with a browser. Note that this creates the documentation for all the
projects in the package. If you prefer to generate the documentation 
only for a subset of these projects, you can edit the file 
  
   coin-Pkg/doxydoc/doxygen.conf 

to exclude directories (using the EXCLUDE variable, for example).

If Doxygen is not available, the html documentation is available at:

   http://www.coin-or.org/Doxygen/


RUNNING MaxCut
==============

1. In MaxCutdir, use './maxcut junger1.par' to run the example code.


CREATING FURTHER INSTANCES
==========================

In the Generators directory there are 4 generators that create graphs
with different edge weight distributions. The first comment in the
files describe what kind of instances they create. They are all
standalone programs; the Makefile shows how to compile them.
